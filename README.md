# Employee Payroll Tracker

### USER STORY/Description 
### As a payroll manager:

1. WHEN I click "Add employee" <br>
THEN I am presented with prompts: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; *first name, last name, salary"* <br>

2. WHEN I finish adding an employee <br>
THEN I am prompted: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*"continue" or "cancel"* <br>

3. WHEN I choose "continue" <br>
THEN I am prompted: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*"add a new employee"* <br>

4. WHEN I choose "cancel" <br>
THEN I see the employee data displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by lastname, and the console shows computed and aggregated data. <br>

### Notes:
Some of the code is glitchy where I am running the window.confirm, but overall, I'm satified enough to let this project go and move onto the next.
